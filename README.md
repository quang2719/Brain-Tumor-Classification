## 📝 Project Description

This project aims to classify brain tumor images using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The project involves creating a CNN model to classify images and applying various methods to address overfitting.

## 📁 Dataset

The dataset used in this project was provided by my teacher, Mr. Hinh.

## 🏗️ Model Architecture

There are two models in this project:

1. **First Model**: This model was initially trained, but it suffered from overfitting with an accuracy of 86.75%.
2. **Second Model**: This model was optimized using my knowledge, resulting in an improved accuracy of 94.5% on the test set.

For detailed training procedures and model architecture, please refer to the `training_model_2` file.

## 📊 Results

* **First Model**: 86.75% accuracy (overfitting)
* **Second Model**: 94.5% accuracy (optimized)
